About Hastings Williams
I was born and raised as the oldest of four in Varnville, South Carolina in March of 1998. At the age of eight my family moved to Brooklyn, New York. During which time, I adopted the practices of Tae Kwon Do and little league baseball. I have resided in Madison, Mississippi since 2012. I graduated Madison Central High School as a Mississippi Tech Scholar and with a 3.43 GPA in 2016. I am also an incoming freshman Biology major in the class of 2020 on a Presidential II Scholarship at Tougaloo College. In 2014 and 2015, I competed in HOSA Epidemiology at the regional, state, and national level.
